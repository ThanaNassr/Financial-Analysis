# Financial-Analysis
This was work done in my python module for analyzing financial data using python and jupyter notebook to present findings. 
The first file task_a+b+c__final which was the group final file presented involved analyzing car accident insurance data and applying several machine learning models—such as multiple regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and K-nearest neighbors—to predict claim costs based on multiple factors commonly used by insurance companies.

I have also included some files I did personally, Task A , Task B and Task C which were files i wrote in contribution to the group project , with task c including only a multiple regression model.
