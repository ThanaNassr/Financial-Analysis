# Financial-Analysis
This was work done in my python module for analyzing financial data using python and jupyter notebook to present findings. 
The first file task_a+b+c__final which was the group final file presented involved analyzing car accident insurance data and applying several machine learning models—such as multiple regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and K-nearest neighbors—to predict claim costs based on multiple factors commonly used by insurance companies.

I have also included files that demonstrate my personal contributions to the project, namely Task A, Task B, and Task C. These files were written by me as part of the group project, with Task C focusing specifically on a multiple regression model.

The last file of Assignment 2 is an analysis of historical cryptocurrency price data for Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC), focusing on price trends, returns, volatility, and comparative risk.

A quick summary of the tasks done here are: 
Collected and analyzed historical daily price data for Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) from January 2022 onward using the yfinance library 

Performed initial data inspection, including dataset structure, column definitions, and data cleaning (e.g. flattening multi-index columns).

Computed descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for key price variables.

Analyzed correlations between price variables and trading volume for both cryptocurrencies.

Identified potential price outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

Visualized price trends over time (Open, High, Low, Close) and examined weekly aggregated trends.

Conducted trading volume analysis, identifying volume spikes and comparing volume with closing prices using dual-axis plots.

Calculated daily returns, cumulative returns, and rolling 30-day volatility to assess performance and risk.

Compared return behavior and volatility between Solana and Bitcoin to highlight differences in risk and price dynamics.
